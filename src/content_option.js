    aboutme: "As a child growing up in India, I was always interested in problem-solving through design. I remember designing a simple but effective irrigation system for my family's farm using locally sourced materials.My passion for thinking to solve problems through design made me become a UI/UX Designer. I have been working in the industry for a couple of years now and I have gained a wealth of experience in creating user-centered solutions. Now, I help businesses to improve and grow by designing and testing user-centered solutions. I specialize in creating user-friendly websites and mobile apps that are tailored to the needs of the end user. I work closely with my clients to understand their business goals and create solutions that will help them to achieve those goals. I can benefit companies and organizations who are looking to improve the user experience of their digital products and services such as websites, apps, or other interactive systems",
